# AI-Powered Chatbot for 24/7 Customer Support and Appointment Scheduling

Description:
I developed an AI chatbot integration designed to act as a 24/7 customer representative, capable of answering common service-related questions, scheduling appointments, and reducing the need for live agent support. The chatbot helps streamline customer interactions by providing instant responses and guiding users through basic inquiries. 

# Challenges:
One challenge I faced was ensuring the bot had enough specific information to handle more detailed or direct questions. Without comprehensive data, the bot often defaulted to escalating conversations to a live agent, highlighting the need for improved knowledge base content and deeper integration with business systems.
